Github ver. "filering 1.0"
Filtering measurements, then re-running findMax with the initialGuess
Filtering just extends "bad lines" towards center of mass of 4 points
The measurement is filtered if distance from center of mass is > fitness of 4 line set
Filtered 64 measurements

Github ver. "filering 1.2"
Added a scaling coefficient to the filtering treshold (the distance from center of mass)

treshold = 0.75

Interestingly enough, if I change it to run with filtered  results from the result, and not the initial guess, the fitness goes way up, but the coordinates stay pretty much the same:

Also: the top left X doesnt seem to move at all whatever you do...


Interestingly enough, this whole time I had it scaled based on tension. If you scale measurements based on tension AFTER the first run (after the filtering) you get shit results:

Github ver. "filering 1.3"
Also, this whole time I had most of the walkLines disabled (down from 0.0001), cause they don't seem to improve results much
So I tried to add some accuracy on the second (filtered) run

Github ver. "alt metrics - intersec point"
Fitness now is avg distance from lines to the point of intersection between lines from two diagonally respective endpoints.
It broke the stagnant countert thing, so I had to add a little bit of wiggle there
